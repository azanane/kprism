## Q-learning (reinforcement learning)

In Q-learning, the agent execute an action a, depending of a state s and the function Q

### Characteristics of Q-learning: 

- This is an algorithm of reinforcement learning
- Every action has a reward, positive or negative
- The training is made by exploring different paths and reseting a Q-table (esperance for each action according on a state)

### Hereâ€™s how it works:
